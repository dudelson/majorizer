2Know2 - Improved Desktop Mnemonic Assistance Tool
==================================================

Features:
	- Given a number, finds a list of words that encode to that number using the major system
	
	
TODO:
	- *** Figure out the implementation of PhonemeList ***
	- Do more refactoring to use PhonemeLists in all the places they should be used
	  (this was a last-minute change and many arguments/return types are still String[])
	- The program searches databases of famous people / other culturally relevant things not found in 
	  ordinary dictionaries
	- words are ranked algorithmically according to certain criteria:
		1) commonality
		2) pictureability: is the word easy to picture in the mind? (Example: Warrior, Counter-example: Fear)
		3) user-rated usefulness (this needs to be implemented after the ranking system)
	- Major System can be re-bound
	- Documentation
	- Unit tests
